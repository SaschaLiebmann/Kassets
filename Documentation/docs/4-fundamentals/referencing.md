# Using Kassets' ScriptableObject Instances

## Usage on MonoBehavior Script

Create a `MonoBehavior` Script and add Kassets' instance as a serialized field.

`Player.cs` :

`HealthBarUI.cs` :

Drag and drop `PlayerHealth` (`FloatVariable`) to `Player`'s `Health` field :

Drag and drop `PlayerHealth` (`FloatVariable`) to `HealthBarUI`'s `Health` field :

From example above, `Player` component's field `Health` and `HealthBarUI` component's field `Health` both refer to the same FloatVariable ScriptableObject instance `PlayerHealth`. Since both component refer to the same variable instance, the `float` value they refer to is shared. Each component then manage their own need with the value without any coupling between components. I.e. `HealthBarUI` doesn't have to request the `Health` value to `Player` component and Player component can manage its own `Health` without the need to distribute its value to other components.

## Usage on UnityEvents

Kassetsâ€™s instance is a ScriptableObject asset. It can be referenced to UnityEvent via Inspector. You can aslo use dynamic method call on UnityEvent to pass a parameter.
