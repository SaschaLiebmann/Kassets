# Quick Start

## Creating Kassets' ScriptableObjects

Instances of Kassets can be created from the `Create` context menu or from `Assets/Create` menu bar. Simply right click in the Project window and select the type of instance you want to create.

### Create a `GameEvent` Instance

For `GameEvent` instances, select any of the provided event types from `Create/Kassets/Game Events/`

### Create a `Variable` Instance

For `Variable` instances, select any of the provided variable types from `Create/Kassets/Variables/`

Below are the preview of Kassets' `Variable` instance on Inspector window.

## Using Kassets' ScriptableObject Instances

### Usage on MonoBehavior Script

Create a `MonoBehavior` script and add Kassets' instance as a serialized field.

`Player.cs` :

`HealthBarUI.cs` :

Drag and drop `PlayerHealth` (`FloatVariable`) to `Player`'s `Health` field :

Drag and drop `PlayerHealth` (`FloatVariable`) to `HealthBarUI`'s `Health` field :

<img width="878" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-19 at 6 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1290720/99601584-0d585400-2a43-11eb-9ce3-dd143e260f0d.png"></img>

From the example above, `Player` component's field `Health` and `HealthBarUI` component's field `Health` both refer to the same `FloatVariable` `ScriptableObject` instance `PlayerHealth`.
Since both components refer to the same variable instance, the `float` value they refer to is shared.
Each component then manages its own need with the value without any coupling between components.
For instance, `HealthBarUI` doesn't need to request the `Health` value from the `Player` component and the `Player` component can manage its own `Health` value without needing to distribute it to other components.

### Usage on UnityEvents

Kassetsâ€™s instance is a ScriptableObject asset. It can be referenced to UnityEvent via Inspector. You can aslo use dynamic method call on UnityEvent to pass a parameter.
