# Quick Start

## Creating Kassets' ScriptableObjects

### Create an Event Instance

Kassets instances can be created from Create context menu or from Assets/Create menu bar. Simply right click on the Project window and select any instance to create. For Event instances, select any of event types from `Create/Kassets/Game Events/`

### Create a Variable Instance

For Variables instances, select any of available types from `Create/Kassets/Variables/`

## Using Kassets' ScriptableObject Instances

### Usage on MonoBehavior Script

Create a `MonoBehavior` Script and add Kassets' instance as a serialized field.

`Player.cs` :

`HealthBarUI.cs` :

Drag and drop `PlayerHealth` (`FloatVariable`) to `Player`'s `Health` field :

Drag and drop `PlayerHealth` (`FloatVariable`) to `HealthBarUI`'s `Health` field :

<img width="878" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-19 at 6 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1290720/99601584-0d585400-2a43-11eb-9ce3-dd143e260f0d.png"></img>

From example above, `Player` component's field `Health` and `HealthBarUI` component's field `Health` both refer to the same FloatVariable ScriptableObject instance `PlayerHealth`. Since both component refer to the same variable instance, the `float` value they refer to is shared. Each component then manage their own need with the value without any coupling between components. I.e. `HealthBarUI` doesn't have to request the `Health` value to `Player` component and Player component can manage its own `Health` without the need to distribute its value to other components.

### Usage on UnityEvents

Kassetsâ€™s instance is a ScriptableObject asset. It can be referenced to UnityEvent via Inspector. You can aslo use dynamic method call on UnityEvent to pass a parameter.
