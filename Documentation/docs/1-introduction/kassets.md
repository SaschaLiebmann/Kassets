# Kassets

Kassets is an implementation of [Scriptable Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) Architecture.
Scriptable Object Architecture provides a clean and decoupled code architecture.
It is implemented based on [Ryan Hipple's talk at Unite Austin 2017](https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk).

Though Kassets can function independently,
it was originally developed to extend the functionality of the libraries [UniRx] and [UniTask] into the Scriptable Object Architecture.
Therefore, it is recommended for enhanced functionality to use Kassets in conjunction with either or both the [UniRx] and [UniTask].
To do so, simply import any or both of these libraries along with Kassets.
