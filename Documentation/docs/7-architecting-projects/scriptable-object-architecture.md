# Scriptable Object "Architecture"

Though named "Architecture", the Scriptable Object Architecture is not meant to be a system architecture as a whole.
Kassets was created with the intention to be used like a messenger, who delivers data from one component to others.
Pretty popular paradigm would be Message-Hub, Pub-Sub, Observer, and others.

Kassets particularly good for prototyping, game-jams, amd small projects which doesn't require architectural design.
Though, you can always use Kassets when making a module that can be reused on another project, even in a large-scale, long-term projects.
In the end, it was the matter of using the right tool at the right time.
Imagine Kassets as another tool inside your toolbox, because not everything can be solved with Kassets alone.
