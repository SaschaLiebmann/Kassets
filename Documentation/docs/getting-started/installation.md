# Installation

Kassets is an implementation of Scriptable Object Architecture. Scriptable Object Architecture provides a clean and decoupled code architecture. It is implemented based on [Ryan Hipple talk on Unite Austin 2017](https://youtu.be/raQ3iHhE_Kk).

Kassets can be used independently. However, Kassets was originally made as an attempt to extend functionality of UniRx and UniTask into ScriptableObjectArchitecture. So, it is recommended and would be more effective to use Kassets along with [UniRx], [UniTask], or both. To use them, simply import any or both of these library along with Kassets.
